How to contribute ðŸ˜ƒ:
1. Clone the repository. 
I have found GitHub Desktop to be a very easy method for cloning repositories. You can download it here: https://desktop.github.com/  

(optional) Easy instructions for cloning the repository with GitHub Desktop: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop

2. Open the newly cloned folder in VSCode. 
3. Make sure you "Fetch origin" before making any code changes to ensure you have the latest code. You can do this via the Github desktop application. 
4. Once you have made a change that you feel should be committed to the main project, you should open a pull request so that we can review your code and merge it with the project. You can do this via Github Desktop.

Additional tip: You can install the "Live Server" extension in VSCode that will make it where your browser automatically updates your code as you edit it. Download link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
